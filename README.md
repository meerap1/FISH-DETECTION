# FISH-DETECTION
The project focuses on developing a model which will detect fish

## Data Source:
The data used in this repository for fish object detection in marine videos was sourced from another repository, which provided annotated video clips. A subset of over 1500 + images from this dataset was selected for training purposes. This curated dataset encompasses both positive and negative images, where positive images contain instances of fish, annotated with bounding boxes and class labels, while negative images depict marine scenes without fish objects.
## Model:
The model employed for fish object detection in marine videos is YOLOv7. Its selection is attributed to its superior performance in real-time object detection tasks, robustness in handling various object sizes, and efficient architecture, enabling rapid inference even on resource-constrained devices.
